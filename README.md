# PCBS English Vocabulary Test
Visual world paradigm experiment designed to compare phonological processing in native and non-native speakers of English. The experiment was coded in Expyriment, code available [here](evt3.py).

## Allophonic processing in a second language
Are late learners of English sensitive to allophonic distributions that don't occur in their native language? Do allophonic relationships affect processing speed in late learners compared to native speakers?

#### Background: Sound patterns in French and English
Nasal vowels pattern phonemically in French (distinguish meaning: *main* = /mɛ̃/, *mais* = /mɛ/) but allophonically in English (only before nasal consonants: *man* = /mæ̃n/, *mad* = /mæd/). If native speakers of English use this distributional nasal vowel cue to "speed up" word recognition, can French learners of English do the same?

#### Task
 Participants are advanced French learners of English and native speakers of English. Stimuli in each trial consist of a nasal-oral minimal pair (bunny/butter) and two phonologically unrelated stimuli (lipstick/teddy bear).

Participants are presented with four images of English nouns with an accompanying auditory stimulus "Click on the X," where X corresponds to either of the nasal-oral minimal pair items. Participants are instructed to click on the picture that corresponds with the auditory stimulus, and reaction times are measured.

#### Predictions

Prediction 1: Slower reaction times for identification of nasal words on behalf of the French group would suggest that French learners of English are not sensitive to the allophonic distribution of nasal vowels in English, and don't take advantage of English allophonic nasality to speed up lexical recognition.


Prediction 2: Equivalent reaction times between the groups would suggest that French learners develop an L2 phonological system that is sensitive to allophonic distributions not present in their native language.
